\
Tānishi, wīpēsākāstēw. I am a second year MSc. research student in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila - The Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en), and very fortunately supervised by [Dr. Blake Richards](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/blake-richards) in the [Learning in Neural Circuits (LiNC) lab](https://linclab.mila.quebec/). <br> 
\
My current research has been generously funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Indigenous Studies Program at McGill University, and supported computationally by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC) and the Innovation, Development and Technologies (IDT) team at Mila.
<br>  

Previously, I completed a bachelors in computer science with psychology at McGill University in 2022 and, before that, a certificate in French as a Second Language at the [University of Regina](https://www.uregina.ca/) in 2018. I also passed the B2 DELF shortly after.<br>

### Research Interests

- **<font color="#730000"> Cooperative behaviour</font>** in multi-agent environments and what constitutes the defintion of an **<font color="#730000">agent</font>** in an environment.
- The **<font color="#730000"> Credit Assignment Problem</font>** in structural, temporal and long-term flavours.
- **<font color="#730000">Neuro-Inspired</font>** algorithms to improve the sample efficiency of good agent behaviour.

During my undergraduate, I was associated with [Encode](https://encodeai.org/) [Canada](https://encodejustice.ca/) where I contributed to AI literacy and ethics initiatives with [blogs posts](https://montrealethics.ai/category/columns/recess/) in the [Montréal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/) and hackathon judging, co-lead the machine learning division of [McGill Neurotech](https://www.facebook.com/McGillNeurotech/) where we created a brain-computer interface speller that learned EEG signals of flashing letter frequency to type by focusing on letters with vision and co-authored a [causal language reasoning paper](https://txtlab.org/2022/05/why-capturing-causal-reasoning-in-narrative/) in my last year.<br>

\
Currently, I am an advisory board member of [Indigneous Pathfinders in AI](https://mila.quebec/en/ai4humanity/learning/indigenous-pathfinders-in-ai) and evidently I am a citizen of [Métis Nation—Saskatchewan](https://metisnationsk.com/about-metis/). <br>
